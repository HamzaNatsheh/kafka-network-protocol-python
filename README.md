A Python implementation for [Kafka Network Protocol](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html).

Tested with Python 3.11.3 and Kafka 3.5.0. APIs used in `util.inspection` module might not work with other Python
versions.

Reading the reference above is very helpful to level-up with Kafka, at least `Preliminaries` section, and is crucial for
understanding this project. However, many details are not covered; using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) and
reading Kafka's source came to rescue with details.
